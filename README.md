# AdventOfCode2020

Python code to solve daily puzzles of http://adventofcode.com/2020

Code is tested with Python 3.8.3 (Anaconda distribution) on Win10. Developed with VSCode.

## Days

* Day 1:  Use of itertools.combintations makes this one easy.  I got to it late (due to server crashes), but it took only a couple of minutes.
* Day 2:  Regex to parse the input string, then loop through and evaluate each item to meet the different password validity rules.  Fumbled around with the regex for a while, because I haven't used it recently.  Part 1: 00:23:47, rank 4973.  Part 2: 00:31:34, rank 4673.
