# AdventOfCode2020

Python code to solve daily puzzles of http://adventofcode.com/2020

Code is tested with Python 3.8.3 (Anaconda distribution) on Win10. Developed with VSCode.

## Days

* Day 1:  Use of itertools.combintations makes this one easy.  I got to it late (due to server crashes), but it took only a couple of minutes.
